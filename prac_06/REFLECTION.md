# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have begun to consistently watch the lecture videos and complement this with additional research online to deepen my grasp of lists, tuples, dictionaries, and classes. This regular engagement has significantly bolstered my comprehension and enhanced my problem-solving abilities.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I plan to dedicate more time to tackling complex problems that require the integration of various concepts such as lists, dictionaries, and exception handling within a unified project. I also need to be more proactive in seeking assistance when I encounter difficulties, utilizing resources available online, and reaching out to classmates and instructors.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

My effective use of Git for version control remains a strong point in my study routine. It has streamlined my workflow by enabling regular commits with clear messages, allowing for easy tracking of changes, collaboration, and reversion to earlier versions when necessary. This methodical approach keeps my code repositories organized and well-documented.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to shift away from relying exclusively on tutorials and begin to independently manage my projects. Engaging directly with practical applications will enhance my understanding and retention of programming concepts. Additionally, I need to address my tendency to procrastinate by starting assignments earlier, thus reducing last-minute stress.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would appreciate more interdisciplinary projects that link programming with other domains, such as data analysis or web development. This cross-disciplinary approach would enrich the learning experience and better equip us for diverse professional challenges."
