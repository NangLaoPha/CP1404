# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
I've completed watching around 75% of the lecture content, skipping only the sections I feel confident in. This helps me focus more on areas where I need to strengthen my understanding.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
I usually find evenings the best time to watch the lectures. I set aside flexible time slots of about an hour for each session, depending on the length of the videos and how much I need to get through.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I'm good at breaking down coding problems and developing structured approaches to solve them. This has been particularly helpful in understanding the practicals, and I'll continue honing this strategy to become even more efficient.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to slow down when coding, as I sometimes overlook smaller details that lead to errors. Taking the time to double-check and refine my code will help me avoid issues later on. 

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
I've realized that I tend to over-focus on small aspects of a task, which ends up consuming too much of my time. I'll start using time management techniques to ensure I stay on track and complete tasks more efficiently.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
I am quite good at understanding how to implement coding solutions for the practicals. My strength lies in quickly identifying the problem and applying the right coding techniques to solve it. I plan to keep this up by improving how I document my work as well.
